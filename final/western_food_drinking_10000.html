		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">This restaurant is mainly for drinking rather than eating. Therefore, since the menu consisted mainly of alcohol and cocktails, representative menu items were randomly selected and written down. First of all, the biggest advantage of this restaurant is that all menu items are really cheap. Usually bars are expensive, but at this restaurant, all menu items are very affordable. For example, the restaurant's menu of cinnamon ginger highballs is 6,500 won, and cheese dipping nachos are 10,000 won. In addition, I thought it was a really good restaurant in that there were a wide variety of snacks as standard snacks and you could bring your own. The atmosphere of the restaurant, the quality of the menu, and the visuals are all good. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to drink in a cozy atmosphere with friends and lovers, or to those who want to drink quietly alone.</span>
