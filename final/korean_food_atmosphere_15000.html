		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">This restaurant is a great place to experience familiar Korean tastes and atmosphere. You can enjoy the familiar and nostalgic taste of eating at home through Korean food menus that remind you of the home-cooked meals your Korean mother made. The menu items I would most recommend at this restaurant are kimchi stew and tripe stew. Both menus are generous in quantity and deep in flavor, making them a filling meal. Moreover, unlike other Korean restaurants, the atmosphere of this restaurant is decorated with a hip interior that young people will like, making it a space that young people can also enjoy. At the same time, the strong composition and taste captivate even older people. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to have a hearty meal with friends, family, and lovers.</span>
