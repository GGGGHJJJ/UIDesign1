		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">This restaurant is a pub where you can enjoy world beer, cocktails, and whiskey along with live performances. It is a restaurant where you can have a drink alone in a cozy atmosphere, watch a performance, or sing and play. The most unique and best thing about this restaurant is the live performance. In this performance, the owner of the restaurant participates by playing and singing, and the customers also sing along, creating an environment for drinking happily. . Additionally, it is basically a restaurant that creates a good atmosphere with delicious snacks and cold drinks. The menu at this restaurant feels a bit expensive, but I think it's a reasonable price considering you can enjoy drinks along with a live performance. At this restaurant, I would like to recommend the flavorful German Wurst topped with German sausage, grilled tomatoes, parsley, basil, Parmesan cheese, onion flakes, and jalapenos. German wurst is one of the most popular menu items in restaurants, ordered and tasted by the most people, and is a generous and high-quality dish. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to drink in a cozy atmosphere with friends and lovers, or to those who want to have fun alone.</span>
