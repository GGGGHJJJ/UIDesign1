		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">This is a restaurant that can boast of having a better atmosphere than any other restaurant. The relatively dark interior is decorated in a vintage style, and beds are placed in the waiting area so that people can wait comfortably. The restaurant has wide space between tables, making it great for personal chats, and the space between them is decorated with vintage items. All of the menu items at this restaurant are rich in flavor and delicious, but the one I would most recommend is the shrimp rosé. Shrimp Rosé is a menu that goes well with the savory taste of plump shrimp and soft, rich rose sauce. This menu consists of the most flavorful and creamy sauce among the shrimp rosés I have ever tasted. It is so delicious that even people who are trying this menu for the first time can enjoy it. If you want to eat a menu with a healthier taste, I recommend grilled anchovies. This menu is a harmonious combination of the saltiness of whole ground anchovies and savory stir-fried eggplant zucchini. So, this is a menu where you can enjoy the savory taste and flavor of eggplant. It's a cool, easy-to-make menu for those who want to try eggplant dishes for the first time. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to dine with friends and lovers while chatting in a vintage atmosphere.</span>
