		<span class="review_content">This restaurant specializes in making Jeju Island food using Jeju pigs. Because it is a restaurant that has been in business for a long time, it is trustworthy and loved by many people. The most popular menu item at this restaurant is meat noodles. Although the price does not exceed 10,000 won, the combination of generous amounts of meat and savory soup makes it a fantastic menu. Because it is very popular with people, you must be careful when visiting the restaurant as ingredients will run out quickly if you do not go early. This restaurant is recommended for those who want to enjoy rich and delicious traditional Jeju Island food, especially Korean food. This is a restaurant where you can have fun either alone or with friends or loved ones.</span>
