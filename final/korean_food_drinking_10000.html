		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">This restaurant may be the restaurant with the most franchise locations in Korea. Because of this, the prices are much cheaper than other bars. The representative menu was selected as an inexpensive menu considering the price aspect, but there are also various menus at various prices. This restaurant's menu changes a lot depending on trends, so if you want to try new and unique dishes, or if you want to enjoy drinks with a variety of foods, this restaurant is recommended. As the restaurant's menu is a brand with many branches, it has the characteristic of being delicious enough no matter where you go. Among the many menu items, many people prefer tteokbokki. Tteokbokki, which has a sweet and basic taste, goes well with any alcohol and is delicious. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to have a light drink with friends and lovers.</span>
