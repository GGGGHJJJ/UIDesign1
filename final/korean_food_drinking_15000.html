		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">This is a great restaurant to have a drink with Korean snacks. This restaurant basically has a noisy atmosphere, making it great for drinking with people and having fun while talking. The most recommended dish at this restaurant is the kimchi stew. This kimchi stew is rich in meat and the portion size is great for the price, so it's great for sharing with a lot of people. This menu is made by boiling a whole large pot and serving it to the table, so you can feel the raw atmosphere. Also, while the prices of snacks at most bars are very high, the prices of snacks at this restaurant are relatively reasonable compared to the amount of snacks, making it a restaurant that young people can easily visit. It is a restaurant where you can enjoy and enjoy the restaurant because both the owner and the staff treat customers kindly. I recommend this restaurant to people who want to have fun talking and drinking with friends and others.</span>
