		<span class="review">Recommended Menu & Review</span>
		<span class="review_content">Although this restaurant is famous for its pizza, the pasta is really cheap and delicious. The reason I chose this restaurant was because it was a place where you can eat high-quality pasta for under 10,000 won, so I would like to recommend the famous pasta instead of pizza. If you like slightly spicy and greasy pasta, I recommend the Hot Spicy Carbonara. This menu has a creamy feel with a special spicy sauce, and is currently the most popular menu item at this restaurant. Everyone who ate this menu commented that the sauce was moderately spicy, delicious, and not greasy. If you are someone who likes pasta with a harmonious combination of meat and tomatoes, I recommend the Meat Lover Pasta. This pasta is a tomato meat pasta made with plenty of ground pork and beef and finished with mozza cheddar cheese. It is full of cheese, has a good flavor, and is selected as one of the restaurant's signature menu items. This restaurant is loved by many people not only because of its delicious food and cheap prices, but also because of its good atmosphere.The interior, which exudes a Western atmosphere, and the neatly organized interior of the restaurant are elements loved by many people. I recommend this restaurant to those who want to have a meal in a nice atmosphere with friends and lovers, and to those who want to enjoy delicious cheap pasta.</span>
