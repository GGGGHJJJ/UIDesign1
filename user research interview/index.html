  <h1><span class="cursive">User Research Interview</span></h1>
  <h2><span class="title">Topic</span></h2>
  <h3><span class="content">: Website for finding restaurants
Each restaurant's reviews and expert evaluations are included to recommend restaurants that you can trust and visit.
This is a website that automatically recommends you if you enter your location, food menu, and personal rating (e.g. spicy, etc.).
The website is a bit of a game format, and if you enter a keyword into the game area, it recommends the corresponding restaurant. (The game is considering things like a wheel, fortune cookies, and lottery.)
-> The website is structured in the form of a slot machine. When you write down your location, food menu, and personal rating, and press the button on the machine, a page recommending restaurants appears.

  <h6><span class="title">Result 1</span></h6>
  <h7><span class="content"><p>1. Usually, when I go to a certain area and want to find a good restaurant, I go to social media such as YouTube or Instagram, but I am confused because I can't tell if the information is accurate or what area I am in.</p> <p>2. I think I gave up trying to find a good restaurant and just followed the menu and went to the restaurant I saw in front of me.</p> <p>3. It once took up to 2 hours.</p> <p>4. The last attempt was around August 2023.</p> <p>5. My current favorite method is to find restaurants through YouTube and Instagram.</p> <p>6. Even if you search on the platform, it is not easy to get the exact information you want.</p> <p>7. It is important to me because when I go to a new area, I want to eat delicious food that is appropriate for that area.</p> <p>8. Rather than creating a way to solve the problem, I have almost given up. However, the method I recently implemented was to find good restaurants by asking people in the area.</p> <p>9. It was difficult to find the most effective way to solve the problem.</p> <p>10. I am trying to use the method of finding good restaurants and organizing them.</p> <p>11. I have never used it separately.</p> <p>12. The reason I have never used a separate product is because it requires effort, such as uninstalling an app, and I think I will like it if it can solve the problem I was thinking of neatly.</p></span></h7>
  <h8><span class="title">Result 2</span></h8>
  <h9><span class="content"><p>1. I usually find restaurants through Naver, but I had a hard time because it seemed to lack reliability.</p> <p>2. Once the main menu is selected, continue searching through Naver.</p> <p>3. It takes 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p> <p>4. The last attempt was made in April 2024. (April 15)</p> <p>5. I like Naver search the most.</p> <p>6. When I looked at Naver’s evaluation, this was where the evaluation and reality were different.</p> <p>7. Since I don't know much about restaurants in the area, I think it's important for me to eat something delicious.</p> <p>8. Nothing has been created to solve a major problem.</p> <p>9. It was difficult to find a way to solve the difficulties arising from searching through Naver.</p> <p>10. We are looking at various platforms such as Naver as well as the YouTube platform.</p> <p>11. No.</p> <p>12. If I use a new website, I think I will need to be more accurate.</p></span></h9>
  <h10><span class="title">Result 3</span></h10>
  <h11><span class="content"><p>1. Not much, just search on Naver and get it by star rating or from the community.</p> <p>2. Search for restaurants on Naver or Kakao Map and rank them in order of star rating.</p> <p>3. Within 20 minutes.</p> <p>4. Last week.(As of April 29th)</p> <p>5. Sort by star rating.</p> <p>6. Annoying.</p> <p>7. I have to make sure I eat something once.</p> <p>8. No, I just put it off because it’s annoying.</p> <p>9. Amount of information.</p> <p>10. Various sites.</p> <p>11. No.</p> <p>12. There are no other products.</p></span></h11>
